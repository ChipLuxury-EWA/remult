# Lazy loading of related entities

When an `entity` is loaded, its `many to one` relation fields are also automatically loaded, using a cache mechanism to prevent the reload of an already loaded `entity`. To disable that, set the `lazy` option to `true`.

let's use the example in [entity relations](entity-relations)

```ts{10}
@Entity("tasks", {
  allowApiCrud: true
})
export class Task extends IdEntity {
  @Fields.string()
  title = ""
  @Fields.boolean()
  completed = false
  @Field(() => Category, {
    lazy: true
  })
  category?: Category
}
```

#### Working with Lazy

- To manually load a related entity, use its `FieldRef`'s load method.
  ```ts
  await task.$.category!.load()
  ```
- If the field was not loaded, and you'll access it - it'll return `undefined` and will issue a request to load the related entity. once that entity is loaded, the field will return its value.
- To check if a field has value, you can use the `valueIsNull` method of its `FieldRef`
  ```ts
  await task.$.category!.valueIsNull()
  ```
- You can override the default `lazy` definitions by setting the `load` option of the repository's `find` method.
  - To load none of the related entities use:
    ```ts
    await taskRepo.find({
      load: () => []
    })
    ```
  - To specify which fields to load:
    ```ts
    await taskRepo.find({
      load: task => [task.category!]
    })
    ```
